# pbi_filestore
Custom visual for using the Power BI product for file storage. Not so much a use case as it is a proof-of-concept / exploration.  
The link to see this visual is posted in the MS gallery: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Power-BI-as-File-Storage/m-p/694335  

There are two folders:  
* filestore - The source code for making the custom visual, created by the pbiviz utility and then modified
* serialize_files - a Python script for serializing the files you want to store into a format to be inserted in PBI tables
